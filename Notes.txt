Only useLoadSavedLineup uses getPlayersInGroup from 'utils'.

Therefore, it is not responsible for the failure to change the default tee in the team tables.

getPlayersInGroup from 'hooks' is responsible for creating the players in group in making a lineup and creating the team tables.

The issue seems to be in failing to update the team tables after changing the default tee.

ChangeTees calls:
    updatePlayersInLineup(teesSelected[course]);
    updateTeamTables(teesSelected[course]);

Isn't this likely to be responsible?
